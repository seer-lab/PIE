Where the front end lives.

## Project Structure

I used the GetX state manager for this project. For more information on 
how to use it, checkout the package page: 

**Controllers :** Handle all non-localized state/logic 
**Struct :** All data objects
**UI :** All UI Widgets. They are *mostly* organized into their seperate panels.

## Development

When debugging uncheck *All Exceptions* in the Exception breakpoints as there are a number of scroll elements that throw exceptions (unless trying to fix this).
